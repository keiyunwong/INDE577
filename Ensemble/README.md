# Ensemble
Author: Xiaoyue Li

## Introduction
This folder implements multiple ensemble learning methods, and evaluates the performance of these algorithms.

Ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.


## Data
### Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. [https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/master/README.md]

Variables contained:

- species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
- bill_length_mm: bill length (mm)
- bill_depth_mm: bill depth (mm)
- flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
- body_mass_g: body mass (g)
- island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
- sex: penguin sex
