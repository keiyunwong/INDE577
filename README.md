- Student: Xiaoyue Li
- Instructor: Randy R. Davila

## Introduction

This Github Repository reproduces all the algorithms in INDE 577 with a different dataset. Many algorithms are implemented from scratch but advanced toolkits like Scikit-learn and Tensorflow are also utilized.

## Progamming Tool

 - Python (version 3.6)
 - Jupyter Notebook

## Content

- Supervised Learning:
    - Single neuron logistic regression
    - Single neuron linear regression
    - Deep neural network (DNN)
    - K-Nearest neighbors (KNN)
    - Decision tree
    - Ensemble methods (bagging & boosting)

- Unsupervised Learning:
    - K-means clustering
    - Principal component analysis (PCA)
